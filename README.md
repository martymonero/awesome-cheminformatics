# Awesome Cheminformatics

A curated list of amazingly awesome cheminformatics tools and resources. 
Cheminformatics (also known as chemoinformatics) refers to use of physical chemistry theory with computer and information science techniques—so called "in silico" techniques—in application to a range of descriptive and prescriptive problems in the field of chemistry, including in its applications to biology and related molecular fields. Inspired by [Awesome OSINT](https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint/).



* [RMG - Reaction Mechanism Generator](https://rmg.mit.edu/)
* [stk](https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk)
* [AiZynthFinder](https://github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder) - AiZynthFinder is a tool for retrosynthetic planning. The algorithm is based on a Monte Carlo tree search that recursively breaks down a molecule to purchasable precursors.
